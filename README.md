# Escape-the-Undead
VR Terror Videogame for HTC Vive


## Emotion

For this Escape Room game, I wanted to make the user change their mind around what ghosts, lost souls and undead creatures in general are. While it still gives a sense of terror, as it's natural, I want the user to feel that he/she has to surpass those fears and embrace a feeling of pity and adquire mercy to those who passed away but are stuck in this world.
